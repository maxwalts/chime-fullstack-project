thanks for taking the time to look over my submit!
If you have any questions on my thought process on something that is not clear from my commit log feel free to ask at mwalts@umich.edu

### Some Notes

1) I made all my commits to master and made more than I usually would just to give a better idea of how I was approaching development, when I had to step away to do something else, etc. 

2) done in 3 sittings between last night and today with about 4 hours of total coding/debugging time

3) most after commit 5af4471e1decc0fa22023dc13460420bdd0438e2 is styling

4) I used semantic-ui-react for baseline styling
