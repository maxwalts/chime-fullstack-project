### From Max
thanks for taking the time to look over my submit!
I usually wouldn't do this, but I made all my commits to master and I did them more often than I had to just to give a better idea of how I was approaching the app, when I had to step away to do something else, etc. If you have any questions on my thought process on something that is not clear from my commit log feel free to ask.

Overall, I completed this in 3 sittings, around 10:10pm to around 12pm on Saturday, 10:30am to 12:30pm this morning, then like 2:20pm  to 3:10 this afternoon. Was trying to keep total coding time close to the 4hour mark.

everything after commit 5af4471e1decc0fa22023dc13460420bdd0438e2 is styling so I could have stopped there.

With extra time I probably would have :
1) added a nav bar to separate the Menu, Add Item, and Add Tag forms, but this addition is trivial
2) separated my on___ functions and conditionally rendered components but I kept them all pretty short so they should be readable as is
3) created a semantic ui theme for styling instead of inline css like I have
