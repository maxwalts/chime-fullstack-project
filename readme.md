thanks for taking the time to look over my submit!
If you have any questions about the final version that is not made clear by comments or the commit log feel free to ask at mwalts@umich.edu.

### Some Notes

1) I made all my commits to master and made more than I usually would just to give a better idea of how I was approaching development, when I had to step away to do something else, etc. 

2) this code was written between last night and today - about 4 hours of total coding/debugging time.

3) most after commit 5af4471e1decc0fa22023dc13460420bdd0438e2 is styling, which I mostly used semantic-ui-react for, with some personal additions.

5) I tried to complete this task while keeping my methods as simple as possible - not importing a module or adding a feature unless I felt like it would be vital / really useful to complete the product.

6) I think my code is a bit messy in parts, which is something I would take care of if given extra time for detail work.
